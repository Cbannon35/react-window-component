# react-window-component

This is a component library that allows you to create a 'browser' within your browser! It is built on top of [react-rnd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-rnd) for its draggable and resizable features.

## TODO:

Quite a lot! This is a very early work

- [x] Basic window
- [ ] Advanced Window styling
- [ ] Complete integration with dependency (react-rnd)
